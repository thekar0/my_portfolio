                    <p>Chimp Test is a Django web app that allows users to participate in various challenges, such as memory and logic tests. Users also can compare their scores with other participants on the dashboard. A feature of the app is the ability to compare users' results against the performance of chimpanzees, often used as a benchmark in cognitive studies. The app is designed to make testing one's cognitive abilities fun. Built on the Django framework, the app ensures secure user data management and smooth challenge functionality along with JavaScript based minigames.</p>

                <h1>Tic Tac Toe</h1><hr>
                <p>Tic Tac Toe is one of the most popular games around the globe, i made this small project to test out the SFML library used in C++. The whole mechanic is based on a 1D array of 9 intergers where their state is either 0, 1 or 2. 0 Representing an empty cell, 1 being an "X" and 2 being an "O". The user can hover their mouse over the board and place their symbol using mouse clicks. The game checks for win conditions after each move, and displays a message when a player wins or if the game results in a draw. Game also contains sound effects.</p>
